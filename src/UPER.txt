[3,2,   4,7, 9,6]
[0,1,   2,3, 4,5]

bubble:
 
set has swapped to true
while has swapprd

do nested for loops set 
 
in second compare arr[i] to arr[j] 

if j < i set temp to arr[i]

 swap arr[i] = arr[j]
 j = temp 

 else swapped = false

 bugs after implemented

 starts switches and then keeps looping i as the lowest
fix: 
set breaks in nested loop if swapped and an else statement with a break 
fix2 in the i set swapped to false and do a while swapped on the inner loop
    then after swap set swapped to true and after the else
    this variable name makes no sense so i renamed it comparison_done
